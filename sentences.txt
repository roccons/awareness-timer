Am I here?
Am I breathing?
Where is my attention?
Am I having fun?
Am I enjoying?
What am I using my time for?
Am I attending what matters?
I take care of my needs
I stop myself
I am aware
I put a purpose for every action
I am present
I am present in every breath
I inhabit my body
Present moment, wonderful moment
I am stardust
I'm always at home
I'm always starting
I am learning
Nothing real can be threatened
I am peaceful
I embrace my fears and insecurities
I acknowledge my successes and my mistakes
I learn from my mistakes
With every breath I come home
